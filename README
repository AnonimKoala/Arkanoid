Arkanoid ~ Suscy koderzy

Web application based on JS.

Requires a server to run properly - VS Code Live Server / XAMPP / etc.

Utilizes localStorage.
Make sure it's cleared before running.
Otherwise, it may disrupt the application's functionality.

In that case, use the following command in the console (F12):
localStorage.clear();
and refresh the browser.

The application's performance depends on the hardware it's tested on.
This significantly affects the ball's speed.
As power decreases, so does its speed.
This also works in the opposite direction.

If the performance is unsatisfactory:

Change the value of the 'ballSpeed' variable on line 2 in the script.js file:
the higher the value, the faster the ball moves.
Restart the game.
If any issues not described above occur, a solution is to refresh the browser window
W przypadku wystąpienia nieopisanych powyżej nieprawidłowości rozwiązaniem
jest odświeżenie okna przeglądarki.
